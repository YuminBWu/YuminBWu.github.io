Project 2 Post
 
For this project, I used regression tree model and boosted tree model to analysze the online news data.       

I read in the data set, set up the training data and test data, summarize and plot the data and then build the models.      

I also create a repo on github for my project.     
 
This project is really an interesting challenge for me. Especially the automation part. It is a very cool and reproducible function. This part is the most difficult part for me.     

I learnt a lot from this project, such as how to generate an analysis report automatically for any values of variables I want.
