Q: What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?       
A: Most things has not changed about what I think a data scientist is and what they do.       

Q: What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?        
A: I will continue to use R. I think R is very useful and helpful. I could run only one or several commands to check if there is any error in my current code. In addition, I like to use R markdown to create my homework files for other courses. It allows the results of code to be directly inserted into formatted documents and it is incredibly easy to use.       

Q: What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?                         
A: I will use shiny in practice. Shiny package is really amazing which makes it easy to build interactive web applications and dynamic dashboards straight from R. It is a great platform to create data visualizations and entire products due to its flexibility.
