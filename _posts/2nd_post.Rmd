Q: What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?   
A:  I learnt SAS during the spring semester of 2020. There are more operators in R(%>%, %%,| ...). In addition, R contains more lengthy codes than SAS. Somethimes, I cannot remember the syntax of R language.  

Q: What functionality do you like about R?   
A: R markdown.  It can turn my analyses into high quality documents, reports, presentations etc.  

 Q: What parts do you miss about your other language?   
 A:  I miss about the proc report in the SAS. It allows more flexibility in displaying the data.  

 Q: Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?  
 A: So far I do not consider R as a difficult language to learn. Just sometimes I forget the syntax of R and need to use help() to check.
