Q: What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
A:  A data scientist is able to gather, process, and derive valuable business insights from  the data.

Q: What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
A:
•	Research and develop statistical models for analysis
•	Understand company needs and devise possible solutions by collaborating with product management and engineering departments
•	Communicate results and statistical concepts to key business leaders
•	Use appropriate databases and project designs to optimize joint development efforts
•	Develop custom data models and algorithms
•	Build processes and tools to help monitor and analyze performance and data accuracy
•	Use predictive modeling to enhance and optimize customer experiences, revenue generation, ad targeting, and more
•	Develop company A/B testing framework and test model quality

 Q: What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
 A: ”A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.” Data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data. Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists. 




Q: How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
A: Statistics is a crucial component of data science. As I am a master of statistics, I am confident that I will be proficient in statistic knowledge in two years. However, about the area of data science, I need to learn much knowledge about computer science.
