Q: What do you think being a data scientist is about?  

A:  A data scientist is able to gather, process, and derive valuable business insights from  the data.

Q: What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

A:
1.	Research and develop statistical models for analysis
2.	Understand company needs and devise possible solutions by collaborating with product management and engineering departments
3. Communicate results and statistical concepts to key business leaders
4. Use appropriate databases and project designs to optimize joint development efforts
5. Develop custom data models and algorithms
6. Build processes and tools to help monitor and analyze performance and data accuracy
7. 	Use predictive modeling to enhance and optimize customer experiences, revenue generation, ad targeting, and more
8. Develop company A/B testing framework and test model quality

 Q: What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
 
 A: ”A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.” Data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data. Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists. 




Q: How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

A: Statistics is a crucial component of data science. As I am a master of statistics, I am confident that I will be proficient in statistic knowledge in two years. However, about the area of data science, I need to learn much knowledge about computer science.
