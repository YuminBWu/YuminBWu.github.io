Q1: What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used? 
A:  I learnt SAS during the spring semester of 2020. There are more operators in R(%>%, %%,| ...). In addition, R contains more lengthy codes than SAS. Somethimes, I cannot remember the syntax of R language.

Q2: What functionality do you like about R? 
A: R markdown.  It can turn my analyses into high quality documents, reports, presentations etc.

Q3: What parts do you miss about your other language? 
A:  I miss about the proc report in the SAS. It allows more flexibility in displaying the data.

Q4: Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?
A: So far I do not consider R as a difficult language to learn. Just sometimes I forget the syntax of R and need to use help() to check.
