Vignettes are explanations of some concept, package, etc. with text, code, and output interweaved.

I created an vignette for reading and summarizing data from the National Hockey Leagueâ€™s
(NHL) API. I created some functions for users to search any information they are interestd in the NHL.

In addition, As I am interested in New Jersey Devils. So I did a data analysis  about it.

I also create a repo on github for my project.

This project is really an interesting challenge for me. For example, writing functions to make users search the data that they need. Writing a wrapper function for them to search the information from all endpoints in the project.  This part is the most difficult part of the logic and programming for me. 

I learnt a lot from this project, such as how to design the conditional expressions, how to create a wrapper function, how to design a data analysis ,etc.
